# Multilinecollapsingtoolbar binding

Android Xamarin binding for libary https://github.com/opacapp/multiline-collapsingtoolbar

_multiline-collapsingtoolbar_ is a replacement for `CollapsingToolbarLayout` from the [Android
Design Support Library](https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_support/tree/master/design)
which can deal with multiline titles (with a customizable maximum number of lines) in the
expanded state. When collapsing the toolbar,  the lower lines of the title fade away to leave
only the top line visible.

**There are two issues ([180736](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=180736),
[215056](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=215056)) in the Android Issue Tracker which request this and/or similar features to be added to the official Design Support Library. We encourage you to star these issues to help make this library obsolete (and relieve us of the burden of updating it with every new Support Library version) in the future.**

## Example
Here you can see the library in action in the included demo app:
